MESSAGE: I want you to understand the fact that i will not repeat myself. We did not implement any sqlite query for this app functionality, the generated query comes from some Google SDK used in the app therefore there are no sensitive data stored in this query, currently we have removed most of this SDK. Refer to item 4 above. There are no sensitive information stored and we have also removed the SDK that generated some query. We do not store Username, Email or Password in any file inside the app. Also the items highlighted in the document titled "Summary of Mobile Application Security Test" are all fonts and other assets that make up the app's UI. JavaScript have been disabled in Webview and loading web pages have now been moved to platform default.
